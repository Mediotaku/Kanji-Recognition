# Kanji-Recognition
This is the repository where is stored everything concerning my final degree project about **Japanese writing recognition using machine learning**. The main tools that we will be using are Keras with Tensorflow backend. The project is meant to be a comprehensive research about the topic and this repository will be updated periodically.
